Kubernetes with Calico networking
=================================

Calico can be used as a network plugin for Kubernetes, to provide
connectivity for workloads in a Kubernetes cluster.

Calico is particularly suitable for large Kubernetes deployments on bare
metal or private clouds, where the performance and complexity costs of
overlay networks can become significant. It can also be used in public
clouds. To start using Calico Networking in Kubernetes, check out our
