Set up Calico on CoreOS using Vagrant
=====================================

These instructions allow you to set up a CoreOS cluster ready to network
Docker containers with `Calico Docker
networking <https://github.com/projectcalico/calico-docker>`__ using
Vagrant.

Streamlined setup
-----------------

1) Install dependencies

-  `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`__ 5.0.0 or greater.
-  `Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html>`__ 1.7.4 or
   greater.
-  `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`__

2) Clone this project

   git clone https://github.com/projectcalico/calico-docker.git

3) There are three demonstration options depending on whether you are
   running with libnetwork, Powerstrip or the default Docker networking.
   Select the required demonstration by changing into the appropriate
   directory:

-  For default Docker networking

   ``cd calico-docker/docs/getting-started/default-networking/vagrant-coreos``

-  For libnetwork

   ``cd calico-docker/docs/getting-started/libnetwork/vagrant-coreos``

-  For Powerstrip

   ``cd calico-docker/docs/getting-started/powerstrip/vagrant-coreos``

4) Startup and SSH

Run

::

    vagrant up

To connect to your servers \* Linux/Mac OS X \* run
``vagrant ssh <hostname>`` \* Windows \* Follow instructions from
https://github.com/nickryand/vagrant-multi-putty \* run
``vagrant putty <hostname>``

5) Verify environment

You should now have two CoreOS servers, each running etcd in a cluster.
The servers are named calico-01 and calico-02 and IP addresses
172.17.8.101 and 172.17.8.102.

At this point, it's worth checking that your servers can ping each
other.

From calico-01

::

    ping 172.17.8.102

From calico-02

::

    ping 172.17.8.101

If you see ping failures, the likely culprit is a problem with the
VirtualBox network between the VMs. You should check that each host is
connected to the same virtual network adapter in VirtualBox and
rebooting the host may also help. Remember to shut down the VMs with
``vagrant halt`` before you reboot.

You should also verify each host can access etcd. The following will
return an error if etcd is not available.

::

    curl -L http://$ETCD_AUTHORITY/version

And finally check that Docker is running on both hosts by running

::

    docker ps

Try out Calico networking
-------------------------

Now you have a basic two node CoreOS cluster setup and you are ready to
try Calico networking.

You can now run through the standard Calico demonstration. There are
three demonstration options depending on whether you are running with
libnetwork, Powerstrip or the default Docker networking.

-  `demonstration with Docker default
   networking <default-networking/Demonstration.md>`__
-  `demonstration with libnetwork <libnetwork/Demonstration.md>`__
-  `demonstration with Powerstrip <powerstrip/Demonstration.md>`__
